I help integrate datasets for the U.S. Armed forces in order to promote collaboration and data access. Along the way I ended up becoming a SECDEVOP by necessity. I am currently working on wrapping our data-transport, data-validation, and data-transform services in customer oriented applications that will allow them to interact and become part of that process.",
